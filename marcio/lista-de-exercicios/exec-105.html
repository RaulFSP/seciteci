    <h1>Java JDK 21</h1>
    <h2><em>Sobre</em></h2>
    <p>Java Development Kit (JDK) 21, the newest long-term support (LTS) release of Oracle’s standard Java implementation, has arrived in a production release. Based on Java 21, the latest version of the Java SE (Standard Edition) platform, JDK 21 ushers in 15 features, including a key encapsulation mechanism API, virtual threads, and previews of string templates and structured concurrency. A proposed 16th feature, the experimental Shenandoah garbage collector, was dropped in June.</p>
    <p>JDK 21 can be accessed from Oracle.com, with support available from Oracle. Oracle will support JDK 21 for at least eight years. The company also announced that long-term support for Java 11, which was released five years ago, has been extended through January 2032.</p>
    <p>Oracle publishes new releases of standard Java every six months. The previous release, JDK 20, arrived March 21. Long-term releases arrive every two years, interspersed by short-term releases backed by six months of support.Oracle publishes new releases of standard Java every six months.

    <h2><em>features of JDK 21 include:</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Structured concurrency, in a preview stage, simplifies concurrent programming via an API for structured concurrency, treating groups of related tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work. This streamlines error handling and cancellation, improving reliability and enhancing observability.</li>
        <li>Deprecation of the Windows 32-bit x86 port for removal, with the goal to remove the port in a future release. The proposal is intended to update the build system to issue an error message when an attempt is made to configure a build for Windows 32-bit x86.</li>
